            I am a 31-year-old, ambitious and dynamic individual who embraces new challenges.
            The training as a laboratory technician and the BSc in Biotechnology have strengthened my knowledge in process technology.
            The bachelor thesis showed me opportunities in IT, which led to my MSc and my deeper interest in programming.

            I am driven by the opportunity to leverage my data science skills to make a meaningful impact.
            With a background in biotechnology and applied computational life sciences, I am passionate about transforming complex scientific data into actionable insights.
            My motivation stems from a desire to bridge the gap between data and decision-making, particularly in fields that influence public health and innovation.
